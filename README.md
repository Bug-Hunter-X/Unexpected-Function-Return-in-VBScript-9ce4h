This repository contains a VBScript function that demonstrates an unusual behavior when dealing with conditional return values. The function `f(x)` is expected to return `x+1` if `x` is greater than 10, and `x-1` otherwise. However, due to implicit variable handling in VBScript, the function behaves unexpectedly when the `If` condition is false. The bug is explained and solved in the `bugSolution.vbs` file.
